# ASIX AX88179 / AX88179A Linux Driver (DKMS Enabled)

This repository contains the **v3.5.0** vendor driver for the ASIX AX88179/AX88179A USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapter, updated with full DKMS support and system automation.

### 🚀 Key Improvements in this Repository:
* **DKMS Support:** Automatically recompiles the driver whenever you update your Linux kernel—no manual rebuilding required.
* **Smart Makefile:** Patched to support the `KVER` variable, ensuring the driver builds against the target kernel headers, not just the currently running one.
* **Automatic Blacklisting:** The `postinstall` script automatically blacklists the stock drivers (`ax88179_178a` and `cdc_ncm`) to prevent them from "stealing" the device.
* **Boot Persistence:** Automatically adds the module to `/etc/modules` so your network interface is available immediately upon boot.
* **Clean Uninstallation:** The `postremove` script intelligently cleans up system configs only if no other versions of this driver remain on the system.

### 🛠 Hardware Identification

This driver is specifically for the **ASIX Electronics Corp. AX88179** chipset (ID `0b95:1790`).

You likely need this driver if your `lsusb` matches:
`Bus 004 Device 002: ID 0b95:1790 ASIX Electronics Corp. AX88179 Gigabit Ethernet`

And your device is being incorrectly handled by the generic `cdc_ncm` driver:
```text
/:  Bus 04.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/4p, 5000M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Communications, Driver=cdc_ncm, 5000M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 1, Class=CDC Data, Driver=cdc_ncm, 5000M
```

---
### 📦 Prerequisites
You must have the Linux kernel headers installed for your specific kernel version.

**For Debian / Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dkms build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

---
### ⚙️ Installation

**1. Prepare the Source**

Clone the repository and move it to the system source directory. The folder name must match the format ax-usb-nic-3.5.0.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/g-host-one/AX88179-driver.git
sudo mv AX88179-driver /usr/src/ax-usb-nic-3.5.0
cd /usr/src/ax-usb-nic-3.5.0
```

**2. ⚠️ Set Permissions (Critical)**

The postinstall and postremove scripts handle the blacklisting and system configuration. DKMS will fail to execute these scripts if the execution bit is not set.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ax88179-postinstall.sh
sudo chmod +x ax88179-postremove.sh
```

**3. Register and Install with DKMS**

```bash
sudo dkms add ax-usb-nic/3.5.0
sudo dkms install ax-usb-nic/3.5.0
```

**4. 🔄 Reboot (Required)**

A reboot is required to ensure the conflicting drivers are fully unloaded and the system initializes the hardware using the new ax_usb_nic driver from the updated initramfs.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---
### ✅ Verification

Check if the high-performance driver and version 3.5.0 are active:

```bash
ethtool -i <your_interface_name>
```

**Expected Result:**

* **driver:** ax_usb_nic

* **version:** 3.5.0

---
### 🗑 Uninstallation

Removing the module via DKMS will trigger the postremove.sh script to clean up the blacklist and boot entries.

```bash
sudo dkms remove ax-usb-nic/3.5.0 --all
```

===============================================================================
ASIX USB3.0/2.0 Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter
Driver Compilation & Configuration on Linux
===============================================================================

================
Prerequisites
================

Prepare to build the driver, you need the Linux kernel sources installed on the
build machine, and make sure that the version of the running kernel must match
the installed kernel sources. If you don't have the kernel sources, you can get
it from www.kernel.org or contact to your Linux distributor. If you don't know 
how to do, please refer to KERNEL-HOWTO.

Note: Please make sure the kernel is built with one of the "Support for 
      Host-side, XHCI, EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI" option support.

================
Getting Start
================

1. Extract the compressed driver source file to your temporary directory by the
following command:
	$tar -xf DRIVER_SOURCE_PACKAGE.tar.bz2


2. Now, the driver source files should be extracted under the current directory.
Issue the following command to compile the driver:
	$make


3. If the compilation is done, the ax_usb_nic.ko will be created under the
current directory.

================
Usage
================

=== Install driver to your system
1. If you want to use modprobe command to mount the driver, issue the
following command to install the driver into your system:
	$sudo make install
Note: This command will backup the built-in ax88179_178a driver if it exists.

2. If you want to load the driver by modprobe command, issue the following 
commands:
	$sudo modprobe ax_usb_nic

3. If you want to unload the driver by modprobe command, issue the following 
commands:
	$sudo modprobe -r ax_usb_nic

4. If you want to check the information of driver, issue the following commands:
	$modinfo ax_usb_nic 

=== Install driver manually
1. If you want to load the driver manually, go to the driver directory and
execute the following commands:
	$sudo modprobe mii
	$sudo insmod ax_usb_nic.ko

2. If you want to unload the driver, just executing the following command:
	$sudo rmmod ax_usb_nic

3. If you want to check the information of driver, issue the following commands:
	$modinfo ax_usb_nic.ko


================
Programmer & IEEE TEST
================
ASIX USB Ethernet Linux Command Line Programming Tool

[Note]: Enable DEBUG message
* Modify ENABLE_IOCTL_DEBUG to y in Makefile.
	ENABLE_IOCTL_DEBUG = n
	->
	ENABLE_IOCTL_DEBUG = y

1. Extract the compressed driver source file to your temporary directory by the
following command:
	$tar -xf DRIVER_SOURCE_PACKAGE.tar.bz2

2. Now, the driver source files should be extracted under the current directory.
Executing the following command to compile the driver:
	$make

3. Load the driver manually, go to the driver directory and execute the 
following commands:
	$sudo modprobe mii
	$sudo insmod ax_usb_nic.ko

4. If the compilation is well, the ioctl will be created under the current 
directory.

Note: The default way to find the interface is to scan the ASIX device using
 the ethx (x: 0~255).It is defined in the file, command.h.
	(As follows)
	...
	// DEFAULT_SCAN   : scan "eth0" - "eth255"
	// INTERFACE_SCAN : scan all available network interfaces
	#define NET_INTERFACE	DEFAULT_SCAN
	#define	DEFAULT_SCAN	0x00
	#define	INTERFACE_SCAN	0x01
	...
Adjust the contents of #define NET_INTERFACE to select the method you want.

================
Enable PTP(Precision Time Protocol)
================
1. If you want to enable the PTP function, please modify ENABLE_PTP_FUNC to 'y' in the makefile, 
	and then recompile it.
	
	ENABLE_PTP_FUNC = n
	->
	ENABLE_PTP_FUNC = y
